## Real Estate Website sketch
Project being done with React, Node (Typescript) and Postgres.\
Additional libraries worth mentioning being used are: React Router, TypeORM, TailwindCSS, Material UI, Axios.

Some utilities used are Insomnia and Beekeeper.

To run the project, you must run an instance of PostgreSQL database, create a database as in the project (named '`estate`'), set `.env` variables.\

Use 2 tabs of the terminal while Docker is not being used in the application and run `pnpm i` in each folder (`web` and `server`). 

If you are unaware of how package managers work, do not switch between npm/ yarn and pnpm.\
You are of course free to run `rm pnpm-lock.yaml` and do a fresh install with your package manager of choice.
